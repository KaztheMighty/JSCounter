# JS Background Changer/Counter
Using JS, you can click a button to increase or decrease the count of the number on the screen by 1. If the number is above 0, the background is green. If it is below 0, it becomes red instead. 

Also commented out code that'd only change the colour of the number itself, so I don't give myself a seizure whilst testing.

Additionally added a reset button to reset the number back to 0.
